							<h4>"... It's SO easy for this guy.... nothing is a problem..."</h4>
							<p class="lead">
								Don't lump this guy in with "chiropractors".   You can plow your way through those back crackers to finally reach Shaneyfelt, and when you do you'll know why he's in a category of his own.
							<p class="lead"> 
							I've never seen anyone that knows more about the body and why it works the way it does..  The effect of what he did was immediate and dead on.... and he started in the waiting room.  He told me several things about myself while I was just standing there like an idiot.  "How long have you been grinding your teeth?"......... "look at how your jaw is clenched right now....it's coming up from the side of neck..."
							</p>
							<p class="lead"> 
							He barely cracks you.  Instead, he manipulates the body in various ways and tells you to watch as your body lets go and relaxes while he works.  Rock hard muscles in your neck suddenly gel out as he works on your leg.  It's SO easy for this guy.... nothing is a problem.  Have you ever had a massage therapist work on a "knot" in your back or neck, and finally  "make a bit of headway" by the end of the session?  This guy won't touch the knot, he'll go move your foot around and massage your hand, and that knot will let go like it never existed.
							</p>
							<p class="lead"> 
							He will educate you during every session.  It's all about the brain and how the spine and body carry it, protecting it.  And it's all about the NERVES coming out of the spine.  If they are interfered with it's not good.  They are what carry every impulse and electric charge to the muscles.  My body was so full of compensation in every muscle that I was basically rock hard in every capacity 24 hours a day.  No wonder I was fatigued, my muscles were working constantly to try to compensate for the nerves being hindered!
							</p>
							<p class="lead"> 
							And he's funny too!  If you're lucky he'll call you sweetheart a few times during the session... "Oh, you haven't seen anything yet sweetheart."  And I'm a GUY.
							</p>
							<p class="lead"> 
							I'm on a three month program to open up the nerves and get my body back to where it needs to be., after that he said it will just be maintenance and I'll be a new man.  After the last session I told him I felt so relaxed in my entire body.  He told me that to be honest I have no idea, even now, of what relaxation IS.  But that I will.
							</p>
							<p class="lead"> 
							Do yourself a favor and get your sorry *ss in to see this guy.  You're welcome for the best advice you've ever been given on Yelp.

							<p class="lead">
								Dr. Shaneyfelt is an AMAZING chiropractor and a great guy. I've tried many, many chiropractors, and he's the only one that's made a significant difference. He cares about his patients, and spends as much time as needed and NEVER does a routine quick-fix. He saved my mom from needing back surgery and keeps me going strong. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

							<p class="lead">
								 I have seen Dr. Shaneyfelt several times over the last decade &amp each time I have been very surprised &amp pleased with the results. After seeing one spine center doctor who prescribed medication, an orthopedist who ordered an MRI &amp recommended injections, a surgeon at U.C. who wanted to do surgery and many p.t. appointments which were mildly helpful, someone recommended Dwight Shaneyfelt. I have had paiin every day for the last two years and after one visit with Dr. S, I feel like I have a new body. I will be going back for that feeling of well being which I walked out of his office with.

							<h4>"...they were always happy to help me..."</h4>
							<p class="lead">
								They make an extra effort to get to know their patients and find out what they need. They always remember me and make me feel very important. Their office was one of the quietest, most peaceful places I've ever visited. I was able to relax very easily. They did not pressure me at all to return. They gave me the information I needed and left the choice up to me. Not only do my appointments never get canceled last minute, they take time out of their day to send me a reminder so I don't forget. They are extremely reliable. They were one of the kindest, most caring staff I've ever dealt with. It didn't matter how many times I called with a question or concern, they were always happy to help me.
